# Turtle Race Game

This project is a fun turtle racing game where you can place a bet on which turtle will win the race. It uses Python's Turtle Graphics to simulate the race, where each turtle moves randomly towards the finish line.

## How It Works

1. **Player Setup**: Six turtles are created, each with a unique color (blue, pink, red, green, yellow, purple).
2. **User Bet**: You are prompted to place a bet by selecting one of the available colors.
3. **Turtle Race**: The turtles move randomly across the screen until one crosses the finish line.
4. **Result**: If the turtle you bet on wins, you will receive a congratulatory message. Otherwise, you are informed that you lost.

## Game Controls

- When prompted, enter the color of the turtle you think will win the race (options: `blue`, `pink`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`).
- The race will start automatically after placing the bet.

## Features

- **Turtle Graphics**: Utilizes Python's Turtle module for visualizing the race.
- **Random Movement**: Each turtle moves randomly forward with a distance between 0 and 10 units per iteration.
- **Betting System**: Allows the user to bet on the winning turtle's color.
